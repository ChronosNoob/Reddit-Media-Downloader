# Reddit-Media-Downloader

This is a python script that will download videos or images from reddit. If the downloaded media is an image it will add the title of the post to the bottom of the screen. This repository will most likely merge and become part of https://github.com/ChronosNoob/Reddit-Post-Exporter
